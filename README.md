# SPOJ

SPOJ (Sphere Online Judge) is an online judge system. Tasks are prepared by its community of problem setters or are taken from previous programming contests. SPOJ allows advanced users to organize contests under their own rules and also includes a forum where programmers can discuss how to solve a particular problem.

## Aims 

- For young people and beginner programmers to develop understanding of algorithms.
- The students of universities are given a chance to do their homework, honestly, thoroughly and without cheating.
- ACM contest pros can solve tasks without being cramped by the restraints of too few programming languages or an inconvenient user interface.
- Enthusiasts of functional or object oriented programming can solve contest problems in their favorite language.
- Any persons willing to share an interesting task with the rest of the SPOJ community can do so nearly automatically.
- Any person, wishing to organize a programming contest, with nearly any rules they may decide upon, may do so at any time they choose, without the help of system administrators.
